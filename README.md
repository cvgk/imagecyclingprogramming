image cycling javascript and html
In this repository when mouse is on an image ,it is automatically changes the images and it takes next image in a time period.
When mouse is over the image it will take the first image.
For this purpose I create a div element in html and it has an id called items_container.
Window addeventlistener method is called in javascript.
then the div element is retrieved.
I created some variables ti is assigned to zero.dir is assigned to folder name.
Then I created two objects called obj1 and obj2.And I put them in an array called array.
Then looping is on the process.
For every object I created a div element, an img element and a span element.
img element and span elements are children for div element.
div element is a child for another div element that's id is items_container.
The rest of the code is event listeners when mouse is on image or off image.
So images changes dynamically.
